Description: GDCRtools was made to download, organize and analyze GDC data. 
    It implements and uses many well-known R packages, as DESeq2, edgeR, WGCNA, and mclust. 
    This is a free open-source software that implements academic research
    by the authors and co-workers. If you use it, please support
