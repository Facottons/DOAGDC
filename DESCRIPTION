Description: In order to download, organize and analyze GDC data we have developed DOAGDC.
    It implements and uses many well-known R packages like DESeq2, edgeR, WGCNA, and mclust.
    This is a free open-source software that implements academic research
    by the authors and co-workers. If you use it, please support
    the project by citing the appropriate journal article listed in
    citation("DOAGDC").
